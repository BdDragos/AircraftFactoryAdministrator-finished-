# FabricaDatabaseConnect-wip-

Database administration program for Airplane-Factory. The program can  (for now) insert, update and delete occurences from one of the tables
that exists in the Aircraft Factory (more exactly the "Motor" table). The program also displays in two DataGridViews the "Avioane" and "Motor"
tables. Since both of them are in a 1:m relationship, by selecting an occurence from "Avioane", which is the "1", it will dispaly in the
DataGrid assigned to "Motor" all occurences of the selected entity that are in "Motor"
